> A Rust-like programming language compiles to JVM Bytecode!
 
## Features
### No implicit conversion!
Yakou does not allow implicit conversion in most scenario, 
including numeric type promotion.
### Enhanced generic system!
Yakou adapts Scala and Kotlin's generic system in order to do more than
Java's does, e.g. Variance.
### More optimization options!
Yakou provides several optimization operations such as **constant folding**,
**constant propagating**, **dead code elimination**.
